# Liver-disease-prediction
There is a tremendous increase of liver sickness patients as a result of exorbitant utilization of  liquor, inhalation of harmful gases, admission of polluted food, pickles and medications. 

Therefore, a lot of burden is put on the doctors to identify if a patient he/she is having any liver disease. This project will help to reduce the burden on the doctor by analyzing patientsâ€™ conditions using soft computing techniques. The methodology to diagnose this disease shows the abilities of the network to learn the patterns corresponding to symptoms of the person and predicts if the person's liver is infected or not. Our neural network models will show good performance in predicting disease with less error. So, overall our project will aid in early diagnosis of liver disease.
Dataset: 
Dataset that will be used is the ILPD ( Indian Liver Patient Dataset ) taken from kaggle -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records

The dataset is basically the blood reports of people residing in the north east of Andhra Pradesh, India. Number of instances is 579. It is multivariate dataset containing 10 variables i.e., age(continuous variable), gender(categorical variable), and 8 other variables which includes total Bilirubin,direct Bilirubin, total proteins, albumin, A/G ratio, SGPT, SGOT and Alkphos. These 8 variables are enzymes that are present in our blood that would help predict this liver disease.
